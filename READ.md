## 🧪 Running Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiteMinimal/edtech-tracker.git
cd edtech-tracker
````

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the FastAPI Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend will run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

---

## 🌐 Frontend

* Open `static/login.html` in your browser (or serve using any static file server)
* App uses **localStorage** to save token and role
* Role-based dashboard redirection
* All fetch requests point to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend (FastAPI) — Recommended: [Render.com](https://render.com)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo on Render
3. Use `uvicorn main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=10000` as start command
4. Set up environment (Python 3.12+, free plan works well)

### Frontend — Options:

* [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* Render Static Site
* Or serve locally

> ✅ **Important:** Change CORS in `main.py` for production domain.
